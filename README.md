## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? First i had to clone the learning reop to my pc to be able to access the code for the site. Went through the code identifing the DEV elements with in the the code and what need to be changed. Changing and saving a few at a time to be be able to see the page and what the changes did, some had to be reworked to make it more visual.

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
