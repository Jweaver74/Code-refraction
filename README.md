## Why I made this site
I edited this site to learn more about code refrection. Changing the elements DIV to inhance the visual apperence of the site.


## What I learned
I learned about the different semantics that can be used throught HTML coding and the effacts it has on the final site.


## Challenges 
Alot of challenges throught this exercise being new to coding and writing HTML. Not sure if correct ones were used and/or the difference it would have made. 
I continue to learn more about the elements and the correct use of proper senatics.
